ItemizedAssets
==============

My first complete iPhone application outside of class assignments.  I completed it on March 22, 2013, just two months after enrolling in an iPhone programming class offered by City College of San Francisco.

This is a simple prototype application that calculates the total worth of your assets, based on the assumption that you only have three types of assets: cash reserves, long-term debt and an IRA mutual fund account whose value changes daily with the stock market.

There are two modes:  "overview" and "settings."  In overview mode, your IRA account's share price is the one value that can be adjusted, as it is the one value that changes daily.  You can do so by moving a slider to set the IRA share price to whatever it's trading on the stock market that day.  In settings mode, you can adjust your cash and debt values, the number of shares you own in the mutual fund account holding your IRA fund, and the minimum and maximum range of share prices that the slider will cover.
